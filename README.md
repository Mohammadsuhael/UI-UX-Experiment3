# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

Compare and analyze the UX of 2–3 competing apps/websites.

Develop and incorporate required changes in the analysed apps/websites.

## Algorithm:

## 1: Select Apps/Websites**

## 2: Define Nielsen’s Heuristics**

## 3: Conduct Heuristic Evaluation**

## 4: Compare UX**

## 5: Suggest & Develop Changes**


## Output:
## Heuristic Evaluation of E-Commerce Apps: Amazon,
 Flipkart, Meesho
 1.Heuristic Evaluation using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics
 ## 1. Visibility of System Status
 ## Amazon: 
 Provides excellent real-time updates for orders, shipping status, and delivery. Users are
 continuously informed through notifications, emails, and app alerts.
 ## Flipkart:
 Similar to Amazon, with clear order tracking and status updates. Flipkart also includes SMS
 notifications for key order milestones.
 ## Meesho:
 Lags slightly in real-time updates. Some users report delays in order status updates, which
 can reduce user trust.
 ## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
 ## Amazon: 
 Uses language and design patterns that closely resemble real-world concepts. For example,
 the cart resembles a shopping cart, and product details are clear and direct.
 ## Flipkart:
 Mostly intuitive with relatable terminology. It mirrors a traditional retail experience well.
 ## Meesho: 
 Occasionally uses vague or unclear language for new users. Some categories and filters are
 not self-explanatory, making it less beginner-friendly.
 ## 3. User Control and Freedom
 ## Amazon:
 Provides easy options for canceling orders, modifying addresses, and returning products
 without hassle.
 ## Flipkart:
 Also offers good user control features, including instant refunds and order cancellation.
 ## Meesho:
 More limited in terms of user freedom. Return policies can be restrictive, and cancellation
 options are not always clearly visible.
 ## 4. Consistency and Standards
 ## Amazon:
 Follows international UI/UX standards with consistent layouts, button styles, and flows across
 the site/app.
 ## Flipkart:
 Maintains consistency in design and functionality across various categories and actions.
 ## Meesho: 
 Occasionally inconsistent; for example, some product listings may look different from others.
 There are visual and navigational inconsistencies that may confuse users.
 ## 5. Error Prevention
 ## Amazon:
 Prevents many errors through confirmation screens, validation messages, and warnings
 before critical actions.
 ## Flipkart:
 Also performs well, especially during checkout and address entry.
 ## Meesho:
 Needs improvement in this area. Fewer prompts and less guidance can result in mistakes
 during checkout or delivery detail entry.
## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
 ## Amazon: Offers personalized suggestions, recently viewed items, and smart reordering options.
 ## Flipkart: Uses machine learning to display personalized product suggestions based on browsing history.
 ## Meesho: Offers some level of personalization but it’s not as advanced or reliable as Amazon or Flipkart.
 ## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
 Amazon: Very efficient—1-click ordering, extensive filtering, voice search, and reorder shortcuts make it
 extremely user-friendly.
 Flipkart: Offers strong filter and sort options, along with recently viewed and wishlist features.
 Meesho: Limited filter controls and sorting options. Product discovery requires more time and effort,
 especially for new users.
 ## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
 Amazon: Clean and professional design, though information-heavy. It manages to organize a large
 amount of content without overwhelming the user.
 Flipkart: Modern and colorful interface. Sometimes banner ads clutter the homepage, but the internal
 product pages remain relatively clean.
 Meesho: Visually cluttered in several areas, especially with product listings. Use of bright colors and
 inconsistent typography reduces clarity.
 ## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
 Amazon: Robust help system with chatbot, FAQ, and quick navigation to resolve problems like failed
 payments or delayed delivery.
 Flipkart: Similar help features with clear ticket status and resolution options.
 Meesho: Help system is slower and less responsive. Many users report issues with delayed responses
 or unclear help pathways.
 ## 10. Help and Documentation
 Amazon: Offers one of the most comprehensive help sections, with easy search and clearly categorized
 issues.
 Flipkart: Strong documentation with embedded support inside the app.
 Meesho: Offers basic help, but lacks detailed documentation or a search feature within help content

 ## 3.Design Improvements and A/B Testing Suggestions
 ## For Meesho:
 Redesign the checkout process into a one-page experience to reduce abandonment.
 Improve return and cancellation visibility.

 Reduce promotional clutter on the homepage and test a cleaner UI.
 Enhance voice search performance.
 A/B Test Example for Flipkart:
 A version: Current homepage
 B version: Cleaned homepage with fewer banner ads
 Metrics to observe:
 Time on page
 Click-through rate to products
 Conversion rate
 ## For Amazon:
 Add smart voice-assisted filters for hands-free shopping.
 Test a simplified mobile navigation bar.
 Tools to Measure Impact
 Quantitative Tools: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Firebase A/B Testing
 Qualitative Tools: Hotjar, Crazy Egg (heatmaps), UserTesting.com (recorded sessions)
 Surveys: In-app user satisfaction polls, feedback forms post-checkout

## Result:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is completed
